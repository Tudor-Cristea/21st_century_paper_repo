## How to Use These Scripts
Each script corresponds to a specific part of the paper:
- **Data cleaning and preparation:** `1_data_cleaning.R`
- **Section 3.1:** `2_section_31.R`
- **Section 3.2:** `3_section_32.R`
- **Section 3.3:** `4_section_33.R`

The scripts were written in R (converted from STATA) and require specific packages. See below for installation instructions.

## Required R Packages
To run these scripts, you will need the following R packages:
- `dplyr`
- `haven`
- `data.table`
- `psych`
- `Hmisc`
- `lavaan`


Finally, save your own data path folder in the first script and use it after. Good luck!
